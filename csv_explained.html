    <h1>Understanding Your TimberTally CSV Output</h1>

    <p class="note">The CSV file you download from TimberTally contains several sections that summarize your forest inventory data for a <strong>specific Area</strong> defined during data collection. If you collected data across multiple Areas (e.g., Area A, Area B), you will get a separate CSV file for each Area. All calculations within a given CSV file use only the data from that specific Area and the settings (BAF, Log Rule, Form Class) selected at the time of export.</p>

    <h2>Section 1: Raw Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> This is simply a direct copy of every single tree entry you submitted into the app *for this specific Area*. Each row represents one tree measurement from this Area.</li>
        <li><strong>Columns:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><code>PlotNumber</code>: The plot number you assigned when measuring this tree.</li>
                <li><code>Area</code>: The Area Letter assigned to this tree (will be the same for all rows in this specific file).</li>
                <li><code>DBH</code>: The Diameter at Breast Height (inches) you entered for this tree.</li>
                <li><code>Species</code>: The tree species you selected.</li>
                <li><code>Logs</code>: The merchantable height in 16-foot logs (or "Cull") you entered.</li>
                <li><code>Cut</code>: "Yes" if you checked the 'Cut' box for this tree, "No" otherwise.</li>
                <li><code>Notes</code>: Any notes you typed in for this specific tree entry. (Quotes within your notes are doubled <code>""</code> to work correctly in CSV).</li>
                <li><code>Latitude</code>: The GPS Latitude, if you captured it for this entry (blank otherwise).</li>
                <li><code>Longitude</code>: The GPS Longitude, if you captured it for this entry (blank otherwise).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How Calculated:</strong> These are your direct inputs for this Area, not calculated values (except for potential formatting like the notes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 2: Tally Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A summary count of your raw data *from this Area*, grouping identical trees together.</li>
        <li><strong>Columns:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Species</code>: The tree species.</li>
                <li><code>DBH</code>: The Diameter at Breast Height (inches).</li>
                <li><code>Logs</code>: The merchantable height in logs (or "Cull").</li>
                <li><code>Cut Status</code>: Whether the tree was marked "Yes" or "No" for cutting.</li>
                <li><code>Count</code>: How many individual tree entries *within this Area* matched this exact combination of Species, DBH, Logs, and Cut Status.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How Calculated:</strong> The app iterates through your raw data *for this Area* and counts how many times each unique combination appears.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3: Per-Plot Volume & Stats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> This section analyzes the variability in estimated volume between the different sample plots measured *within this specific Area*. The Settings Used (BAF, Log Rule, Form Class) listed at the top of this section apply to these calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Columns/Rows:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Plot</code>: The unique plot number you entered *within this Area*.</li>
                <li><code>Volume (BF/Acre)</code>: This is key! It's the total estimated Board Foot Volume Per Acre calculated using only the trees measured on this specific plot. Each tree on the plot has its volume calculated (based on DBH, Logs, Rule, FC) and expanded to a per-acre value using its TPA (<code>TPA = BAF / Tree BA</code>), and these are summed up just for that plot.</li>
                <li><code>Num Plots</code>: The total number of different plots you entered data for *within this Area*.</li>
                <li><code>Mean BF/Acre</code>: The simple average of the <code>Volume (BF/Acre)</code> values calculated for each individual plot *in this Area*.</li>
                <li><code>Variance</code>: A statistical measure showing how spread out the individual plot volumes are from the mean (average) *for this Area*. Higher variance means more variability between plots in this Area. (Requires at least 2 plots in the Area).</li>
                <li><code>Std Dev</code>: The Standard Deviation. It's the square root of the Variance and gives a measure of the typical difference between a single plot's volume and the average plot volume *for this Area*. (Requires at least 2 plots in the Area).</li>
                <li><code>CV (%)</code>: The Coefficient of Variation. It's the Standard Deviation divided by the Mean, expressed as a percentage (<code>(Std Dev / Mean) * 100</code>) *for this Area*. It's a standard way to compare the relative variability. (Requires at least 2 plots in the Area).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How Calculated:</strong> The app first calculates the VPA for each plot *in this Area* individually, then applies standard statistical formulas (mean, variance, standard deviation, CV) to that list of plot VPA values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 4: Forestry Report Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What it is:</strong> This is the main summary of your forest stand *for this Area*, estimating the average conditions per acre based on all the plots measured *within this Area*. The Settings Used (BAF, Log Rule, Form Class) listed at the top apply to all calculations in this section.</li>

                <li><code>TOTAL VOLUME/ACRE (BF)</code>: The estimated average total board foot volume on one acre *of this Area*. (Calculated by summing the VPA contribution of all trees from all plots *in this Area*, then dividing by the number of plots *in this Area*).</li>
                <li><code>VOL/ACRE CUT (BF)</code>: The portion of the total volume/acre *for this Area* that comes from trees marked 'Cut'.</li>
